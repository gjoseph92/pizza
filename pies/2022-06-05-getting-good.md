Notes from a few sessions.

Starter looked funky, so made a commercial yeast only dough based on a combination of https://ooni.com/blogs/recipes/avpn-standard-pizza-marinara and https://ooni.com/blogs/recipes/cold-prove-pizza-dough (which are nearly the same).

| Ingredient | Percentage |
|------------|------------|
| Flour      | 100%       |
| Water      | 60%        |
| Salt       | 3%         |
| Yeast      | 0.3%       |

220g per pizza was a perfect target size for the 12" ooni.

The first out of the oven was probably the best pizza I've made.

Notes on the success:
* Longer preheat time was key (30min?). Ooni claims it gets to 900ยบ in 15min, but it doesn't. Wait until it's really hot.
* Letting dough balls dry a little and develop rind before working lets them slide off peel with no flouring (rindy side down). This is probably a New Mexico-specific technique, and didn't always work. Don't get too cocky.

New sauce recipe:
* Remove tomatoes from can individually by hand. Shake off liquid, open them a little and let internal liquid drain off. Drop into strainer
* Shake strainer to drain excess liquid, then transfer to bowl
* Add a few pinches of salt and lightly mash by hand with pastry blender. Just enough that it could reasonably be spread on a pizza, but quite chunky

I messed up basic reading skills and accidentally made ~12 pizzas worth of dough. Froze the extra in pre-rolled balls after a few days sitting in the fridge, and it worked great. The gluten was better developed than ever before. Somehow freezing + a few days cold proving improved things and developed the flavor.
