# Major innovation

Haven't posted any updates in a while, since I've been going with the same recipe and process. However, today we had a major breakthrough ✨innovation✨ in pizza technology that deserves a quick writeup. Haven't updated the main instructions yet in the README, just jotting this down.

**tl;dr: put the stretched dough onto a wire mesh splatter screen before topping; use this to let most of the flour underneath shake off.**

Background: a big issue has been the balance between:
* too little flour while stretching dough, and too little flour on peel, and it sticks and calzones itself
* too much flour and that flour burns on the hot stone and gives a bitter taste

I know things like perforated pizza peels exist for this purpose, to let excess flour fall off, but I didn't want to buy a fourth (!!) pizza peel.

But we already have a wire mesh splatter screen (probably 12"?), and it turns out that:
1. it lets flour fall through quite well, especially with some gentle tossing from the wrist
1. even after shaking flour, the pizza can sit on it without sticking for quite a while
1. it fits (barely) in the 12" ooni, and if you're fast, you can even launch a pizza straight off of it

So the process was basically:

1. Stretch the dough on the old big wooden peel (16"?) with tons of flour.
1. Slide it onto the mesh screen. Most of the excess flour underneath will fall through.
1. Shake it and toss up and down a little to let all the excess flour fall out
1. Add toppings as usual
1. Either slide onto launching peel, or launch directly into the oven from the screen

A few other notes:
* Easy on cheese
* Leaving out for rind probably doesn’t help
* First one good because stone is so hot. Because there’s less stone temp, maybe turn down flame for later pizzas so air temp and stone temp are more balanced?
* Flour reduction helps a lot, but still burning them. A little more eager to rotate and lower air temp?
* Don’t go all the way to the edge with sauce. It can roll over and stick, but more importantly it’ll burn. Crust will puff where it wants to regardless.
* A little burn is less of a big deal with low flour, especially on leftovers. A day later, the ones I'd thought were too burnt tasted just the same as the others.
