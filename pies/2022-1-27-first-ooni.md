Used King Arthur bread flour

10-12min mix before adding more flour
10min rest before more flour

Things seemed to really go off the rails. I think I must have mis-measured something. Too much flour? Too little water? Was the spoon in the bowl when weighing something?

Pretty lumpy when mixing second flour. Like little dried-up bits from the edge of the bowl were mixed in? Maybe scrape bowl better?

Only added a little of second flour (less than half) but felt done, and not that wet.
Ended up turning out onto bench and hand-kneading a minute, adding a little flour by hand (maybe 30g?). But in the end the weight was exactly the same as before kneadingâ€”maybe from what got left on the bench?

Note: cover with wet towel while sitting so it doesn't dry out.

Final dough: 1356g
Pie size: 271g
