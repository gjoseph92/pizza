Hydration: 75%?!

| Actual quantity | grams |
|-----------------|-------|
| Flour 1         | 639   |
| Salt            | 16    |
| Starter         | 62    |
| Water           | 548   |
| Flour 2         | 91    |

Used King Arthur bread flour
Starter only fed once after long rest, and sat for a few days first.

10-12min mix before adding more flour
10min rest before more flour

Things seemed to really go off the rails. I think I must have mis-measured something. Too much flour? Too little water? Was the spoon in the bowl when weighing something?

Pretty lumpy when mixing second flour. Like little dried-up bits from the edge of the bowl were mixed in? Maybe scrape bowl better?

Only added a little of second flour (less than half) but felt done, and not that wet.
Ended up turning out onto bench and hand-kneading a minute, adding a little flour by hand (maybe 30g?). But in the end the weight was exactly the same as before kneading—maybe from what got left on the bench?

Note: cover with wet towel while sitting so it doesn't dry out.

Final dough: 1356g
Pie size: 271g

## Cooking notes

Bake 2/3

Proved dough in the boiler room proving cabinet ~2h? Doesn't seem very responsive.

Reading at center of stone was generally 700-750º. Also, it was cold out (~10ºF).

Everything cooked really well, and rose very well. The first pizza rose a bit more than others; may have been hotter. After that, turned the gas down slightly.

Centers were sometimes slightly soft; almost felt like stone wasn't hot enough compared to the air. May have turned it down a little too much. Or not enough time to reheat in between?

Sauce was also very good; much better than last time. Still making them slightly too wet? Also wanted more cheesiness, and using more cheese was good and generally worked. Cheese seemed to "crack" a little and leak some oil, which was kinda tasty actually (remember to try sauce-dollop on top though). Still want to try dry/shredded mozzarella just to get more cheese on there.

## Retro

Consensus was, this was excellent. I think the sauce helped a lot, but everyone seemed to think the ooni cooked better than self-cleaning mode.

Pizzas were a tiny bit small? Aim for slightly larger pie size next time; maybe 290g?

Also, the lack of hardly any prove/rise didn't seem to matter. Way better than last time; nothing was over-proved.
