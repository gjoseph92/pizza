## Cooking notes

35g flour left at end

637 + 212 - 35 = 814 total flour

6min hand mix before flour 2

~15min mixing while adding flour 2

20min post-mix rest

Final: 2024 - 594 = 1430g dough

Pie size: 286g

Didn’t rise at all in fridge

Baked 12/28 (4 days in fridge). Took out dough a few hours before baking and that was too much. Maybe 1-2h before would have been good.

Stone at ~900ºF when baking. Self-clean worked great and didn’t seem sketchy. Took almost 1.5 hours to get to temp; went fast at first but then slow progress past 600º.

Cook times 2:30-3min. 3min was a bit burnt. 2:40-45 seemed best.

## Retro:

- A little too salty. Maybe 20g next time?
- Tomato sauce underwhelming. Too watery, so couldn’t put enough on? Try for chunkier next time.
- Over-proved dough, a little too puffy.

In general, this is a great thin crust pizza. It’s not a LoCoco’s pizza, or Rosa’s, which is kind of what I actually want. But really good.
