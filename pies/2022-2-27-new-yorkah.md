# New York ish

Trying [Kenji's New-York-style recipe](/new-york-kenji.md).

Date: Feb 27, 2021 2:00 PM

Doughs in red-lidded tupperwares got ~20sec in food processor after forming a ball. Nalgene tupperwares got 60-90sec. None passed windowpane, but more time maybe developed gluten a little more?

Moved to fridge after an hour or room-temp rising. Nearly doubled in size just in that hour.

Baked 1 day later, Feb 28.

* Really good! This is what I'm looking for. Sauce was the best part.
* Hard to get Ooni temp low enough to fully cook without burning the crust. This may be a better one for a conventional oven tbh. Stone temps around 650-750 gave probably 4min bake time, but ended up with a burnt crust every time. Most times the crust looked perfect for a while, then I just left it in a moment too long wanting the center to cook more.
* Dough was hard to work; gluten not very developed. Needed many rests during stretching. Not sure why; food processor technique didn't seem to work as well as promised. More water maybe?
* A bit over-proved/too thick. Less yeast? Don't allow the room-temp rise? Tried to squeeze bubbles before stretching.
