# Pies n pie

![Bad photo, good taste](/images/2022-09-01/results.jpeg)

Made 4 pies (probably actually 5-6) with new sourdough starter (made from scratch since the fungal incident). Different order: starter, water, salt, flour. Used safeway pre-sifted bread flour since it was there. Added ~1/4 teaspoon of yeast since I wasn't sure of the starter (regrets).

Made 8 with yeasted cold-prove recipe from last time (also safeway bread flour):

| Ingredient | Percentage |
|------------|------------|
| Flour      | 100%       |
| Water      | 60%        |
| Salt       | 3%         |
| Yeast      | 0.3%       |

1. Use warm-ish water, not that it matters, then mix in yeast and salt
1. Add 2/3 of flour, mix for a few mins for gluten, rest 10min
1. Add rest of flour, mix until forms a ball, rest again
1. Knead for 10min on a lightly-floured surface
1. Transfer to Cambro, rest 20min, and cold prove in fridge for 24-72h.

Tip: if making multiple batches, interleave them. This builds in autolyse/resting time while you work on the other.

Note: learned from the dry yeast jar that 0.9g yeast = 1/4 teaspoon. I did 3.5 scoops with the 1/4 teaspoon to get the 3.2g of yeast.

## Bake day

These were hella good.

#### Sauce: slapped.

![Bianco DiNapoli whole peeled tomatoes were the winner](/images/2022-09-01/tomato-kom.jpeg)

Used Bianco DiNapoli and Organico Bello. Bianco was clearly sweeter and more flavorful out of the jar. The can was also the cutest. Couldn't honestly tell the difference on the pizza though, but I'd go for Bianco again unless it's much more expensive.

Just tomatoes, salt, olive oil. Added thinly sliced garlic directly onto sauce on pizzaâ€”could have mixed in too though.

#### Dough

Only baked sourdough. Dough hydration and consistency was excellent. Easily workable, well-developed gluten. 3 days cold prove seemed perfect. Guests gave lots of compliments.

Should not have added the commercial yeast. Slightly too puffy. Talenti jars (of yeasted dough) blew up.

#### Toppings

* Spicy italian sausage from Whole Foods deli counter was delicious
* Applegate farm beef/pork giant uncured pepperonis: pretty good, not as good as sausage.
* Really good yellow tomatoes, coarsely cubed. This was low key the best. They kinda caramelized and were amazing.
* Rehydrated dates. mmmmmm.
* Mozzarella. (note: keep away from Laura.)
* Fresh basil

#### Baking notes

* Did most on low flame while in the oven. It was actually too low. The cheese and sauce didn't quite cook, though it did help avoid burning. With proper pre-heating, 50% power is good for the bake.
* Long pre-heat time crucial as usual. Probably at least 30min.
* Amy brought peach pie for post-pie. Suggest repeating this.
