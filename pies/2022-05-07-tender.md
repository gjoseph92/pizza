Ate a pizza from [tenderfire](https://www.tenderfirekitchen.com) and it was really good. Much more good than ours. We wanted to figure out how to make ours more good so then we went home and made eight pizzas.

Things we liked from tenderfire:
* Very tangy sauce with some bigger chunks, pea sized
* Heavier saucing than would have thought
* Flaky salt crystals on top
* Quite thin, not that much rise in crust either
* Maybe a little underbaked, but didn't mind. High hydration
* Great cook on the crust. The charred spots tasted better than ours (likely wood vs gas, and maybe the humidity of burning wood vs gas)
* Dates were hella good
* Fennel seeds also hella good

We figured our crust is pretty good already. Main thing I noticed about tenderfire was the sauce. It was significantly better, but also seemed very simple.

So we bought 2 doughs from TJs with the goal of ignoring the crust and just experimenting with:
* sauce
* bake/char
* toppings

Some things we did:
* Made sauce from _just_ San Marzano tomatoes (and salt? IDR.)
* Strained tomatoes from juice, tried to get juice out of their insides too
* Tried different blend levels:
    * Hand dice
    * Med food process
    * Strained juice
* Also tried hand diced unripe roma tomatoes from TJs
* Soaked dates in hot water for juiciness
* Pepperoni from TJs

For crust, rather than each bag making 2 pizzas, we made 4 from each. They were maybe 8"? Quite smaller than usual, but I think that did help with baking overall. Still managed to burn many, but mostly from inattentiveness rather than need for more cooking.

### Conclusions
* Bigger isn't better. Make them smaller than the full 12" so they don't burn.
* Just-tomato sauce was really good
    * Best seemed to be mixing coarse + fine chop with salt, oil, and a little of juice liquid.
    * Maybe you could accomplish this by just food-processing the strained tomatoes?
* Dates are damn good too
* Pepperoni was surprisingly good too
* Forgot to use fresh mozzarella, damn it! Dry was okay, but fresh would be better for this style.
