Made 8 from the classic Varasano recipe. Adding instant dry yeast, since proving has been an issue the past few times. Starter also seems extra unresponsive today. Maybe because I haven't fed it in months. Use maybe 1/4 bread flour, rest King Arthur All Purpose.

71% final hydration. Dough came together very well. 2359g total. Split into 4.

Great crust. Maybe even slightly too much rise from yeast?

Made some with vegan cheese. Better than expected, but not as good as normal cheese.

Still struggling not to burn them.
