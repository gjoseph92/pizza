# Big production

Date: Mar 5, 2022 10PM

Made 8 dough, cooked 6. Tony, Ginevra, and Alexei were in attendance.

Mashup of Kenji's and Varasano's recipes:
* Ratios from my sourdough (Varasano), plus 2.3% sugar
* Autolysed like usual (75% of flour)
* Mixed autolyse in food processor in small batches to work gluten rapidly, since mixing that much dough by hand would be a lot of work
* Then added rest of flour (proportional to batch) to food processor to form ball
* The gluten developed really well with this, but it was an awful mess. Wet dough leaked out of the bowl, had to clean every time. Would need a larger food processor with a different bowl mechanism to actually work.

Stored 4-pizza-sized doughs in large containers in fridge, then portioned before baking.

Didn't have enough prove time. Basically no proving happened (maybe 1h out of fridge at most?), and crust was underbaked on the inside. Almost no rise under the toppings; just the crust rose, and generally larger bubbles. Once again, usually burnt crust trying to get middle cooked fully.

Alexei and Tony helped stretch. Sped up production but actually meant we could bake faster than the stone could reheat. Letting the stone get back up to temp was crucial for thorough cooking.

Ginevra made sauce. Took longer to cook down than expected (didn't drain any juice out this time). I added extra sugar and salt at the end on impulse. Was too sweet.

The leftover Neapolitan sauce (tomatoes, garlic, basil processed but not cooked) was the crowd favorite. Had been frozen for a couple weeks, so the garlic flavor was intensified. Also water separated from tomatoes, so you could spoon out the solids and squeeze liquid out, which eliminated the moisture problems this sauce had in the past.

Used all combos of fresh and dry mozzarella, Neapolitan and New York sauce. Favorite seemed to be Neapolitan sauce with dry mozzarella.

Takeaways:
* Let it prove! And maybe? add a little instant yeast even with sourdough (for faster proving)
* Don't over-sweeten sauce
* Leave enough time between pizzas for stone to re-heat
