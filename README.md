## Sourdough

Adapted from [Jeff Varasano's](http://www.varasanos.com/PizzaRecipe.htm) recipe. [Numbers worksheet](/dough-worksheet.numbers).

| Ingredient (grams)                  | Baker's % |
|-------------------------------------|-----------|
| Flour                               | 100       |
| Water                               | 70        |
| Sourdough starter at ~50% hydration | 7         |
| Kosher or Sea Salt                  | 2.3       |
| Yeast (optional)                    | 0.1       |

1. Mix water and salt.
1. Mix in starter<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>.
1. Unless you know your starter is vigorous and active, sprinkle in some commercial yeast too and mix<sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>.
1. Add 75% of the flour<sup id="a3">[3](#f3)</sup>, mix to combine, autolyse‚Äîaka rest 20min.
1. Mix ~5min by hand or in mixer. Dough will be very wet. This is where most of the gluten is working, even it seems like nothing's happening.
1. Add rest of flour, bit at a time, and mixing. Don't care about getting to the target number. Stop adding once dough, lightly dusted with flour, feels soft and smooth. Should still be wet, soft, and slack.
1. Rest a few minutes.
1. Transfer to large container, or individual-size (250g) portions in smaller containers, or some combo thereof. Lightly oil the containers first.
1. Store in fridge for 1-4 days

<a id="f1" href="#a1">1</a> The condition of the starter doesn't seem to matter much. I don't care if it's fed and bubbly, or just out of the fridge after a month without feeding. The latter is probably better tbh. Also: if you mix unfed starter into your dough, isn't that basically a feed?

<a id="f2" href="#a2">2</a> I just use sourdough for flavor and dough conditioning, not rise. If it's inactive, it's also then easier to predict how much rise you'll get from it (nearly none). So I add commercial yeast to get rise. Try to use less than you'd think‚Äîtoo much puff gives a dough that feels too bready and overwhelms the toppings.

<a id="f3" href="#a3">3</a> I usually just use all-purpose flour and it's delicious. Bread flour or 00 could be better, idk‚Äîyou might also want to decrease hydration by ~5% for those.

## Yeasted dough

A simple dough, cold-proved dough made with commercial yeast. This is honestly just as tasty as the sourdough when it's had a few days to sit in the fridge‚Äîtime is key. Adapted from [Ooni](https://ooni.com/blogs/recipes/cold-prove-pizza-dough) [recipes](https://ooni.com/blogs/recipes/avpn-standard-pizza-marinara). [Numbers worksheet](/dough-worksheet-yeasted.numbers).

| Ingredient | Percentage |
|------------|------------|
| Flour      | 100%       |
| Water      | 65%        |
| Salt       | 3%         |
| Yeast      | 0.3%       |

1. Use warm-ish water, not that it matters, then mix in yeast and salt
1. Add 2/3 of flour, mix for a few mins for gluten, rest 10min
1. Add rest of flour, mix until forms a ball, rest again
1. Knead for 10min on a lightly-floured surface
1. Transfer to Cambro, rest 20min, and cold prove in fridge for 48-72h.

Tip: if making multiple batches, interleave them. This builds in autolyse/resting time while you work on the other.

Prior to baking, portion into ~250g pieces.

## Sauce

Key is high-quality canned San Marzano tomatoes, like Bianco DiNapoli and Organico Bello (see [image](/images/2022-09-01/tomato-kom.jpeg)).

1. Put a strainer in the sink. Put a bowl under it to catch the juice.
1. Dump can into strainer, shake to drain.
1. Break open each tomato to let the internal liquid out. You can squeeze each one in your hand a bit too.
1. Shake strainer, squish to drain as much liquid as possible (fine to break them up). Maybe even let it sit. Then transfer to food processor.
1. Add some thinly-sliced cloves of garlic, a healthy amount of salt, some pepper, dried basil, and glug of olive oil. Process until smooth enough to spread evenly, but ideally not a total puree to retain a little texture.

1 can seems to make 250ml of sauce. Still need to measure how much sauce typically goes on a pizza.

## Bake day

### Prep

1. Remove everything from fridge ~3h? before baking
1. Slice mozzarella and leave out to dry for a couple hours
1. Put dough in a warm place to prove if it doesn't seem bubbly already (probably won't). Don't let it over-prove: want bubbles to just be starting to grow, so heat & steam will expand them while baking.
1. Get all ingredients ready and laid out
1. Lightly, evenly flour bench

### Bake

1. Start oven. When temp on center of stone reaches ~800¬∫F (30min pre-heat), start prepping pizza
1. Per pizza:
    1. Scrape/pour dough out onto floured bench. Dust flour on top, then gently spread on bench by pushing outwards from center. Pick up as necessary and let gravity/gentle pulling stretch it bigger. Go gently; rest a few seconds between spreads. Keep floured lightly, but enough to be smooth (not sticky) and easy to work.
        1. On the first iteration, you can do this again so you have two stretched doughs. If aiming for speed, you can have one dough resting post-stretch while the other bakes‚Äîthe few mins of rest will let you stretch it a little more when transferring to the peel. _However_, the stone needs time to re-heat between pizzas, so the Ooni usually can't keep up with rapid baking.
    1. Lightly flour peel and spread flour around
    1. Transfer rested, stretched dough to peel
    1. Shake peel to ensure dough isn‚Äôt stuck
    1. Spread about 2/3 the sauce you think you need. Less in the center, 1-3cm from edge
    1. Shake peel again
    1. Lay wetted fresh basil (unwashed) on top
    1. Grate tiny bit of parmesan on top
    1. Shake peel again
    1. Place 8-10 small pieces of cheese
    1. Sprinkle salt
    1. Shake peel again
    1. Launch into oven!
    1. Watch for when crust near the flame starts rising (~30sec?). Give it a couple extra seconds to crisp, then quickly remove with peel, rotate 90¬∫, and put back. Repeat for all 4 sides. Total cook time: ~2:30.
    1. Remove from oven with peel, place on cooling rack
    1. Season with black pepper & olive oil
