## Dough:

1. Autolyse: fully mix ingredients with 75% of the flour, rest 20min

7. Put in fridge for 1-6 days

## Toppings

### Sauce (make at same time as dough)

1. Crush tomatoes (but not full puree) with immersion blender/food processor
1. If tomatoes taste bitter, rinse them:
    1. Pour into strainer with bowl underneath
    1. Rinse with water. While water is red, swap another bowl underneath and pour red water back over
    1. Once water runs clear, keep rinsing in batches until water coming out no longer tastes bitter
    1. End up with ~1/3 less weight (in water) than you started with from the can
1. Refrigerate
