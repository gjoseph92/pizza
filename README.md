## Dough:

1. Autolyse: fully mix ingredients with 75% of the flour, rest 20min
1. Hand mix ~5min. Dough will be very wet. This is where most of the gluten is working, even it seems like nothing's happening.
1. Add rest of flour, bit at a time, and mixing. Don't care about getting to the target number. Stop adding once dough, lightly dusted with flour, feels soft and smooth. Should still be wet, soft, and slack.
1. Rest 15-20min
1. Pour out onto floured surface and portion into ~298g pieces
1. Store individually in extremely-lightly-oiled containers
1. Rest 10min
1. Put in fridge for 1-6 days

## Sauce (make at same time as dough)

1. Strain tomatoes from 1 can San Marzano or equivalent (this will be enough for ~10 pizzas)
1. Add tomatoes, 1-2 cloves garlic, generous salt (1-2 tsp?), sugar (3 tsp??), olive oil, fresh basil to food processor
1. Pulse a few times until saucy, but still chunky
1. Refrigerate

## Bake day

### Prep

1. Remove everything from fridge ~3h? before baking
1. Slice mozzarella and leave out to dry for a couple hours
1. Put dough in a warm place to prove if it doesn't seem bubbly already (probably won't). Don't let it over-prove: want bubbles to just be starting to grow, so heat & steam will expand them while baking.
1. Get all ingredients ready and laid out
1. Lightly, evenly flour bench

### Bake

1. Start oven. When temp on center of stone reaches ~700¬∫F, start prepping pizza
1. Per pizza, do this as quickly as possible:
    1. Scrape dough out with rubber spatula onto floured bench. Dust flour on top, then gently spread on bench by pushing outwards from center. Pick up as necessary and let gravity/gentle pulling stretch it bigger. Go gently; rest a few seconds between spreads. Keep floured lightly, but enough to be smooth (not sticky) and easy to work.
        1. On the first iteration, do this again so you have two stretched doughs. Generally, you want to have one dough resting post-stretch while the other bakes‚Äîthe few mins of rest will let you stretch it a little more when transferring to the peel.
    1. Lightly flour peel and spread flour around
    1. Transfer rested, stretched dough to peel
    1. Shake peel to ensure dough isn‚Äôt stuck
    1. Spread about half the sauce you think you need. Less in the center, 1-3cm from edge
    1. Shake peel again
    1. Lay wetted fresh basil (unwashed) on top
    1. Grate tiny bit of parmesan on top
    1. Shake peel again
    1. Put 8-10 small pieces of cheese, put a small dollop of sauce on top to protect from heat
    1. Sprinkle salt
    1. Shake peel again
    1. Launch into oven!
    1. Watch for when crust near the flame starts rising (~30sec?). Give it a couple extra seconds to crisp, then quickly remove with peel, rotate 90¬∫, and put back. Repeat for all 4 sides. Total cook time: ~2:30.
    1. Remove from oven with peel, place on cooling rack
    1. Season with black pepper & olive oil
