## Dough:

1. Autolyse: fully mix ingredients with 75% of the flour, rest 20min
2. Mix ~5min, then start adding rest of flour and mixing
3. Rest 15-20min
4. Portion into ~298g pieces
5. Store individually in extremely lightly oiled containers
6. Rest 10min
7. Put in fridge for 1-6 days

## Toppings

### Sauce (make at same time as dough)

1. Crush tomatoes (but not full puree) with immersion blender/food processor
2. If tomatoes taste bitter, rinse them:
    1. Pour into strainer with bowl underneath
    2. Rinse with water. While water is red, swap another bowl underneath and pour red water back over
    3. Once water runs clear, keep rinsing in batches until water coming out no longer tastes bitter
    4. End up with ~1/3 less weight (in water) than you started with from the can
3. Refrigerate

### Mozzarella

Drain/dry mozzarella in paper towels for hours and refrigerate

## Bake day

1. Remove from fridge ~80min before baking. Start oven on self-clean cycle with glass loosely covered in foil, stone on lower rack loosely covered in foil
2. Get all ingredients ready and laid out
3. Lightly, evenly flour bench
4. Lightly flour peel and spread flour around
5. When temp read on foiled stone reaches 850¬∫F (actually top of oven), remove stone foil and start prepping pizza‚Äîstone should be ~700¬∫F
6. Per pizza, do this as quickly as possible:
    1. Scrape dough out with rubber spatula onto floured bench. Four bae a dusting on top, then gently spread on bench
        1. Should not pull back much. Go gently; rest a few seconds between spreads
    2. Transfer to peel, shaking off excess flour
    3. Shake peel to ensure dough isn‚Äôt stuck
    4. Spread about half the sauce you think you need. Less in the center, don‚Äôt go too close to edge
    5. Shake peel again
    6. Lay wetted fresh basil (unwashed) on top
    7. Grate tiny bit of parmesan on top
    8. Shake peel again
    9. Put 8-10 small pieces of cheese, put a small dollop of sauce on top to protect from heat
