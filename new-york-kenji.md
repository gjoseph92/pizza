| Ingredient (grams)         | 1 Pie | 2 pies | 4 pies | Baker's % |
|----------------------------|-------|--------|--------|-----------|
| All-purpose or bread flour | 200   | 400    | 800    | 100%      |
| Warm water                 | 130   | 260    | 520    | 65%       |
| Sugar                      | 5     | 10     | 20     | 2.5%      |
| Salt                       | 4     | 8      | 16     | 2%        |
| Instant yeast              | 2     | 4      | 8      | 1%        |
| Olive oil                  | 2     | 4      | 8      | 1%        |


1. Combine flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in bowl of food processor. Pulse 3 to 4 times to incorporate. Add water and olive oil. Run food processor until mixture forms ball that rides around the bowl above the blade. Continue processing 60 seconds longer.

2. Roll dough in your hands and pinch into a ball. Put ball in lightly-oiled lidded container and seal. If baking today: leave out at room temp for 2-3h. If baking later: place in refrigerator and allow to rise at least 1 day, and up to 5.

3. At least two hours before baking, remove dough from refrigerator and shape into balls by gathering dough towards bottom and pinching shut. Flour well and place each dough ball in a separate medium mixing bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and allow to rise at warm room temperature until roughly doubled in volume.

4. 20min before baking, start preheating Ooni on high. Turn single dough ball out onto lightly floured surface. Gently press out dough into rough 8-inch circle, leaving outer inch higher than the rest. Gently stretch dough by draping over knuckles to form a 12-inch circle about 1/4-inch thick. Transfer to pizza peel.

5. Spread approximately 2/3 cup sauce evenly over surface of crust, leaving 1/2- to 1-inch border along edge. Evenly spread 1/3 of cheese over sauce. Slide pizza onto baking stone and bake until cheese is melted with some browned spots and crust is golden brown and puffed, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer to cutting board, slice, and serve immediately.
