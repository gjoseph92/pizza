# Kenji's Ooni New-York-Style Pizza

From https://www.seriouseats.com/new-york-style-pizza / https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qU7nRd9fiU, scaled to 12" pizzas.

| Ingredient (grams)         | 1 Pie | Baker's % |
|----------------------------|-------|-----------|
| All-purpose or bread flour | 200   | 100%      |
| Warm water                 | 130   | 65%       |
| Sugar                      | 5     | 2.5%      |
| Salt                       | 4     | 2%        |
| Instant yeast              | 2     | 1%        |
| Olive oil                  | 2     | 1%        |

Note: if making multiple pizzas, make each dough separately otherwise you'll overload the food processor.

1. Combine flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in bowl of food processor. Pulse 3 to 4 times to incorporate. Add water and olive oil. Run food processor until mixture forms ball that rides around the bowl above the blade. Continue processing 60 seconds longer.

2. Roll dough in your hands and pinch into a ball. Put ball in lightly-oiled lidded container and seal. If baking today: leave out at room temp for 2-3h. If baking later: place in refrigerator and allow to rise at least 1 day, and up to 5.

3. 1-2 hours before baking, remove dough from refrigerator and shape into balls by gathering dough towards bottom and pinching shut. Flour well, add flour to container, shake with lid on, and place each dough ball back into floured container. Cover and allow to rise at warm room temperature, but don't let it grow too much.

4. 20min before baking, start preheating Ooni on high. Turn single dough ball out onto lightly floured surface. Gently press out dough into rough 8-inch circle, leaving outer inch higher than the rest. Gently stretch dough by draping over knuckles to form a 12-inch circle about 1/4-inch thick. Turn oven down to low. Transfer to pizza peel.

5. Spread sauce evenly over surface of crust, leaving 1/2-inch border along edge. Grate a little parmesan, then add cheese.

6. Launch into oven and bake ~30sec per side. Try to keep as far from the flame as possible, so the center can get more cooking time without burning the curst. Err on the side of rotating well before the crust burns! If crust is done but center is not, you can always turn off the oven and leave it in there (back will still be hot and crust can still burn even with flame off, though).

## Sauce

From https://www.seriouseats.com/new-york-style-pizza-sauce

* 1 28-oz can whole peeled San Marzano tomatoes
* 1tbsp olive oil
* 1tbsp unsalted butter
* 2 cloves garlic, grated on microplane
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano
* Pinch red pepper flakes
* 1 medium yellow onion, peeled and cut in half
* 2 springs fresh basil with leaves

* Salt

1. Puree tomatoes until still have small chunks but not completely smooth
2. Combine oil and butter in medium saucepan and heat over medium-low heat until butter is melted.
3. Add garlic, oregano, pepper flakes, and large pinch salt and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant but not browned, about 3 minutes.
4. Add tomatoes, onion halves, basil sprigs, and sugar. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to lowest setting (bubbles should barely be breaking the surface), and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced by half, about 1 hour.
